             I am deeply passionate about data analytics & engineering, driven by the transformation of raw data into meaningful insights. Through diverse internship experiences, I've honed analytical skills, accelerated data analysis, and automated processes, fostering a commitment to unraveling hidden stories within data for informed decision-making and innovative solutions.

Additionally, my enthusiasm extends to entrepreneurship, shaped by a 6-month internship in Munich, Germany, at a startup. Currently residing in N-House, an entrepreneurial residence, I thrive in a dynamic community that nurtures collaboration and innovation among like-minded individuals.

In my free time, I also find joy in hitting the gym or expressing myself through singing!
